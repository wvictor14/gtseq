Description: Traditionally, analysis of related biological sequences through multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is done through standalone software programs like [Jalview](https://www.jalview.org/), [Rasmol](https://www.openrasmol.org/), and many others, or online web apps like [NCBI's msa viewer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/msaviewer/). Recent additions like [`ggmsa`](https://yulab-smu.top/ggmsa/), Bioconductor's [`msa`](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/msa.html), among others, have brought visualization and analysis to the R ecosystem. But sequences are not often visualized in table packages like `gt`. This package facilitates bringing these traditional bioinformatic activities to R and `gt`.
